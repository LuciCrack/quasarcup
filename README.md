### Developing

Run both frontend and backend servers by following these instructions.

* You must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and Cargo (which comes by default with Rust) installed
* It is recommended to use Trunk and Just for easier development
* Install [Trunk](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk) with `cargo install trunk` and [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) using `cargo install just`
* Use `git clone` to get this repo
* Run both backend and frontend servers using `just start-dev`
* You should then be able to connect to localhost port 8080 for the frontend ([http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)), and backend request to port 3000
